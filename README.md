Spotify being the top music providing service currently is used by more than a billion of the human population.As fans of kpop, and various cross-linguistic music genres, we've been using spotify for so many years now, and the timed-lyrics feature is a relatively new one. The original lyrics are displayed without any problem; however, the translation of lyrics from certain languages to english pose a major threat to some users who may get offended by the distorted translations provided by Spotify. In order implement our proposed system, we have used the same lyric-provider service which is currently being used by Spotify - which is "Lyrics Genius". In our prototype, we've created a sample application using tkinter which is coloured-schemed with the basic spotify theme.
